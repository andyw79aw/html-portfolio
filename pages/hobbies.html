    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Web Development</h2>
    <p>After being made redundant from my role in RBS after nearly 29 with the company, I 
        began a course in Full Stack Web Development, with a view to changing my career. This
        is something I've always been interested in and am delighted to be able to spend the time 
        developing this personal interest into a new career for me.
    </p>

    <h2>Golf</h2>
    <p>After finishing playing rugby in my early thirties I began playing golf regularly. 
        I have now been a membeer of my local golf club, <a href="https://www.glenberviegolfclub.com/">Glenbervie Golf Club</a> 
        for the last 3 and a half years and try to play at least twice a week. Fitting this in around
        work and family is sometimes difficult but it's something I am passionate about and am fortunate to have the opportunity to play regularly at such a prestigous golf club</p>
